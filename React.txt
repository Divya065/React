React is the most popular javascript library.
Used by netflix and Instagram
REact is a library, not a framework.
React uses the react virtual DOM.
React fir creates the exact copy of the DOM.
Then figure out which part is new and only updates that part in virtual DOM.
Finally, REact copies the only new part of virtual DOM.

JSX will be translated into normal javascript bu Babel.

Some Important rules if JSX
1. We can't retrun more than one HTML once.
2. we can use JSx inside for loop, if-else,cases.
3. HTML attribute names like "class" becomes "className".
4. HTML tages must always be closed.

React has two types of components
1. Functional: These are stateless component and return react component.
    Eg: fucntion Welcome(props){
        return <h1>Welcome{props.name}</h1>
        }
    Eg: function example(){
        return(<h1>I'm a functional component</h1>)
        }
    Eg: const Example=()=>{
        return(<h1>I'm a functional component</h1>)
    }

2. class : They are more complex than functional components including contructors.
    Eg : class ExampleComponent extends component{
        render(){
            return(
                <h1>I'am a functional component</h1>
            );
        }
    }

How to call ?
<ExampleComponent/>

                                                              props

React is a component-based library which divides th UI into little reusable pieces. In some cases, those components need to comunicate and
the way to pass data between compoents is by using props.

props is a special keyowrd in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one compoent to another.

But the important part here is that data with props are being passed in a un-directional flow.

Furthermore, props data is read-only, which means tha t data coming from the parent should not be changed by child compoent.

class ParentComponent extends component{
    render(){
        return(
            <h1>
            I'm the parent component
            <ChildComponet/>
            </h1>
        )
    }
}
